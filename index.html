				<h4 class="jus"> Clash Royale is a mobile card game. The goal of the game revolves around destroying the enemy tower (big red health bar on the opposite side). You do this by placing cards on your side of the screen and letting them cross the bridge to reach the opponent (though spells can be placed anywhere). In any given game, you have 8 cards that serve their own roles. However, they all cost elixir. Elixir is something you gain over time and maxes out at 10. Careful use of elixir to make sure you always have enough reserve to defend while spending enough in your attack is a key component of this game. Lastly, at any given time, you can play 4 out of your 8 cards. Your 8 cards cycle and, to get to your other cards, you must place down one of your current lineup. This is why sometimes decks  revolve around having cheap units to quickly cycle back to the most important card.  </h4>

The fireball is great at killing medium-health targets, so it is usually placed whenever these medium-health targets are hindering other cards.	Optimally, because it attacks an area, you would want to wait to hit multiple units in its area to get the most value. </td>

							<td> The Inferno Dragon is mainly used as a "wallbreaker". It locks on a target and increases its damage over time, meaning that, as long as it has time to attack continously, it can shred down anything very quickly. Therefore, you use this card mostly when a high-health tank is coming towards your tower, optimally with some sort of unit infront of it so nothing kills/distracts it.  </td>

							<td> The Electro spirit is mostly used as a "cycle card". It is useful in the fact that it can 1) restart the charge time of some units (like the Inferno Dragon) and 2) can misdirect attacks towards itself rather than more important units. However, its best use is that it's cheap. You can place this down almost costless to try to cycle other key cards to your deck. </td>

							<td> The Ram-Rider is used as a  "win condition". These are cards that you rely on to win, with everything else supporting it with various roles. When it is placed down,  it heads straight to the tower (if there is no defensive building) and slows down everything that tries to kill it. This is best used when there are other cards to kill the buildings that might distract it and defend from hits that might kill it. </td>

							<td> The Mega Minion is used as a great all-rounder. It counters most cards on defense and has the great attribute of targetting dangerous air units. It is great, cheap support. It is usually used in the early game when both sides are still thinking of a strategy and there is no major commitment/push.</td>
